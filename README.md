# Monster Game
written in Java to enfore the theory. Usage of maven to handle the project management. The game generates the battle board and randomly moves the monsters reprisented by their 1st name letter initial around the board. 


+ Arrays
+ Loops 
+ Object orientated programming 
+ Apache commons Array Utils library

### Bug 
1. Throws the array out of bound during monster movement but it is unclear why as there are checks for out of bounds index. See Monster class, move method while loop, lines 97 - 145
